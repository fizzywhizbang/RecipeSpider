# RecipeSpider
A recipe website scraper to insert into database for retrieval
Similar to a prject written php https://github.com/onetsp/RecipeParser this one is using python to scrape recipe sites
Storing in mysql/mariadb
using iterative crawler to avoid the recursive limitation in python.
Still a work in progress and remember run this at your own risk it does have the potential of crashing a computer :)
